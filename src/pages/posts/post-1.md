Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro and share my progress!

## What I have completed so far
1. **Installing Astro**: I installed node.js, npm.
2. **Creating a new project**: I used _npm create@astro latest_ to create a template.
3. **Making new pages**: I learnt how to add new pages to the website and buttons to navigate them.
4. **Making the first blog post**: I made this post your reading right now!

## What's Next?
I will continue through the Astro tutorial and finish my personal blog.
